Here's a Python program that reads input from standard input and outputs the number of groups that will not be accepted into the theater:

```python
# Read input
N, M = map(int, input().split())
groups = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize variables
total_visited = 0
rejected_groups = 0

# Process each group in order
for group_size in groups:
    if total_visited + group_size > N:
        rejected_groups += 1
    else:
        total_visited += group_size

# Output the number of rejected groups
print(rejected_groups)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The first line contains two integers, `N` (the number of seats in the theater) and `M` (the number of visiting groups).
   - The second line contains `M` integers representing the sizes of each group.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `total_visited` keeps track of the total number of visitors currently in the theater.
   - `rejected_groups` counts how many groups are rejected due to insufficient seats.

3. **Processing Groups:**
   - Iterate through each group size in the order they signed up.
   - If adding the current group's size to `total_visited` exceeds `N`, increment `rejected_groups`.
   - Otherwise, add the current group's size to `total_visited`.

4. **Output:**
   - Print the number of rejected groups.

This program ensures that it reads input correctly and processes each group according to the problem statement, outputting the correct number of rejected groups.
