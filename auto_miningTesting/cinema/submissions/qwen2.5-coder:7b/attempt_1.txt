Here's a Python program that reads input from standard input, processes the data according to the problem description, and writes output using `print()`:

```python
# Read input values
N, M = map(int, input().split())
groups = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize variables
seats_available = N
groups_not_accepted = 0

# Process each group in order
for group_size in groups:
    if group_size <= seats_available:
        seats_available -= group_size
    else:
        groups_not_accepted += 1

# Output the number of groups not accepted
print(groups_not_accepted)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The first line is split into two integers \( N \) and \( M \) which represent the number of seats in the theater and the number of visiting groups, respectively.
   - The second line is split into a list of integers representing the sizes of each group.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `seats_available` is initialized to \( N \), the total number of seats available.
   - `groups_not_accepted` is initialized to 0 to count how many groups will not be accepted.

3. **Processing Each Group:**
   - For each group size in the list, check if there are enough seats available:
     - If the group size is less than or equal to the number of seats available, subtract the group size from `seats_available`.
     - If not, increment the count of `groups_not_accepted`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, print the number of groups that will not be accepted.

This program reads input directly from standard input using `input()` and writes output to the console using `print()`. It adheres to the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.
