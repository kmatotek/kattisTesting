Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
# Read input data
N, M = map(int,input().split())
groups = list(map(int,input().split()))

# Initialize counter of rejected groups and available seats
rejected_groups = 0
seats_left = N

for group in groups:
    if group > seats_left:
        rejected_groups += 1
    else:
        seats_left -= group

print(rejected_groups)
```
This solution works by iterating over the list of visiting groups. For each group, it checks if there are enough available seats to let them in. If not, it increments a counter for rejected groups; otherwise, it decreases the number of available seats accordingly. At the end, it prints out the number of rejected groups.
