I apologize for the confusion caused by my previous response. I understand now that the problem is related to cinema tickets, and the error was due to a logical mistake in my code.

The correct solution for this problem is:
```python
N = int(input())
M = int(input())
seats = []
for i in range(M):
    seats.append(int(input()))
accepted_groups = 0
rejected_groups = 0
for group in seats:
    if accepted_groups + group <= N:
        accepted_groups += group
    else:
        rejected_groups += 1
print(rejected_groups)
```
In this solution, we first read the input from standard input using `input()` and store it in variables `N` and `M`. We then create an empty list `seats` to store the sizes of each visiting group. We iterate through each group size and check if it can be accommodated in the available seats. If it can, we add its size to `accepted_groups`, otherwise we add it to `rejected_groups`. Finally, we print the number of rejected groups as output.

I hope this corrected solution helps you pass all the test cases. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
