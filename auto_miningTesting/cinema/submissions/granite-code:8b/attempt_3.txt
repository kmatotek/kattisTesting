Here is the corrected Python code for this problem:

```python
def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    groups = list(map(int, input().split()))
    num_accepted = 0

    for i, group in enumerate(groups):
        if N - sum(groups[:i]) >= group:
            num_accepted += 1

    print(M - num_accepted)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```


The mistake was that the condition `N - sum(groups[:num_accepted]) >= group` should have been `N - sum(groups[:i]) >= group`, where `i` is the index of the current group being considered. This ensures that each group gets a chance to be accepted based on the available seats before considering the next group.
