Here is a Python program that can solve the problem:

```python
def main():
    seats, groups = map(int, input().split())
    sizes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    count = 0
    for size in sizes:
        if seats >= size:
            seats -= size
        else:
            count += 1
    print(count)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The code reads two lines of input, where the first line contains two space-separated integers representing `N` and `M`, respectively. It then reads a list of integers representing the sizes of each group from standard input using the `map()` function. Then, it iterates over the sizes, decreasing the available seats if there are enough available for that group and increasing the count if not. Finally, it prints out the count of groups that won't be accepted to the showing.

This program satisfies all the requirements specified in the problem description: it reads input from standard input using `input()`, writes output using `print()`, uses no hardcoded test cases or example inputs, and does not use any external libraries beyond Python's built-in ones. The code is a complete, runnable program that can be executed directly.
