Here is a Python program that can solve this problem:

```python
def cinema_visitors():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    groups = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    total = 0
    rejected = 0
    for group in groups:
        if total + group > N:
            rejected += 1
        else:
            total += group
            
    return rejected

print(cinema_visitors())
```
This program works by first reading the number of seats `N` and the number of visiting groups `M`. It then reads the sizes of each group, one at a time. For each group, it checks if adding this group to the total number of visitors would exceed the limit `N`. If so, it increments the count of rejected groups. Finally, it returns the number of rejected groups.
