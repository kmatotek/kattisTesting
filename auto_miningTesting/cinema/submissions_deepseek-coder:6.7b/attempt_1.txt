Here is a Python solution for the problem. The code reads input from standard input using `input()`, writes output using `print()` and uses only internal Python libraries (no external ones):

```python
# Read N and M
values = list(map(int, input().split()))
N, M = values[0], values[1]

# Read group sizes
group_sizes = list(map(int, input().split()))

total_visitors = 0
rejections = 0
for size in group_sizes:
    total_visitors += size
    if total_visitors > N:
        rejections += 1

print(rejections)
```

This program works by reading the number of seats (`N`) and groups signed up for the showing (`M`). It then reads the sizes of each group that signed up. For each group, it adds its size to a running total of visitors. If this total exceeds `N`, the group is rejected, and the program increments a rejections count. Finally, it prints out the number of groups that were not accepted.
