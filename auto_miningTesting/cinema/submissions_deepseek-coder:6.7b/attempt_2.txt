I apologize for the confusion. I misunderstood the problem initially. Let's revise the Python program based on the updated problem description:

```python
# Read N and M
values = list(map(int, input().split()))
N, M = values[0], values[1]

# Read group sizes
group_sizes = list(map(int, input().split()))

rejections = 0
total_visitors = 0
for size in group_sizes:
    if total_visitors + size > N:
        rejections += 1
    else:
        total_visitors += size

print(rejections)
```
In this program, we first read the input for `N` and `M`. Then, we read the group sizes from standard input. For each group size in the order they were signed up, if adding that group's size to `total_visitors` exceeds `N`, we increment `rejections`; otherwise, we add the group size to `total_visitors`. Finally, we print out the number of rejections.
