```python
def count_unaccepted_groups(total_seats, number_of_groups, group_sizes):
    unaccepted_groups = 0
    remaining_seats = total_seats

    for group_size in group_sizes:
        if group_size > remaining_seats:
            unaccepted_groups += 1
        else:
            remaining_seats -= group_size

    return unaccepted_groups

# Reading input from user
total_seats, number_of_groups = map(int, input().split())
group_sizes = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculating the result
result = count_unaccepted_groups(total_seats, number_of_groups, group_sizes)

# Printing the output
print(result)
```

This Python program reads the total number of seats in the theater and the number of groups as well as their sizes from the user. It then calculates how many groups will not be accepted into the theater due to insufficient empty seats. The `count_unaccepted_groups` function iterates through each group size, checks if it can fit into the remaining seats, and updates the count of unaccepted groups accordingly. Finally, the result is printed to the console.
