Here is a Python program that solves the problem:
```
# Read input from standard input
n = int(input())
m = int(input())
group_sizes = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Calculate the number of groups that will not be accepted to the showing
num_groups = 0
for group_size in group_sizes:
    if group_size > n:
        num_groups += 1

print(num_groups)
```
This program takes the input from standard input, and outputs a single number that represents the number of groups that will not be accepted to the showing. The input is expected to be in the format specified in the problem statement, where the first line contains the integers $N$ and $M$, the number of seats in the theater and the number of visiting groups, respectively. The second line contains $M$ integers â€“ the size of each visiting group in the order in which they signed up for the showing.

The program calculates the number of groups that will not be accepted to the showing by iterating over the list of group sizes and counting the number of groups that exceed the maximum number of seats. The final output is the total number of groups that will not be accepted to the showing.
