The issue with the previous solution is that it does not handle the case where the input number is already divisible by 10 without leaving a remainder. In this case, adding 99 to the number would result in a number that is not divisible by 10, and subtracting the remainder of (N + 99) divided by 100 would also not give the correct result.

Here's the corrected solution:
```python
n = int(input())
if n % 10 == 5:
    print(n)
elif n % 10 == 0:
    print(n + 99)
else:
    if (n + 99) % 100 == 99:
        print(n + 99)
    else:
        print(n + 99 - ((n + 99) % 100))
```
This solution adds an additional condition to check if the input number is already divisible by 10 without leaving a remainder. If this is the case, it simply prints the number plus 99 without subtracting any remainder. This ensures that the output is always divisible by 10 and meets the requirements of the problem.
