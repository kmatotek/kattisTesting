```
n = int(input())
if n % 10 == 5:
    print(n)
else:
    if (n + 99) % 100 == 99:
        print(n + 99)
    else:
        print(n + 99 - ((n + 99) % 100))
```
This code uses input() to take a positive integer N as an input, then divides it by 10 to find the last digit of N. If N ends in 5, it prints N. Otherwise, it adds 99 to N and checks if the result ends in 99. If it does, it prints the result. If not, it subtracts the remainder of (N + 99) divided by 100 from (N + 99) to find the closest number that ends in 99.

Input: An integer N representing the price of a product.
Output: The closest positive integer to N that ends in 99, with ties resolved by printing the larger number.
