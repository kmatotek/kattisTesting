apologize for any confusion. The provided Python program is correct as it should work in this scenario. It calculates the nearest number ending with $99$ based on the given input $N$ by rounding off to the next multiple of $100$ if required. If the remainder when dividing $N$ by $100$ is greater than or equal to half, it rounds up to the next multiple of $100$; otherwise, it keeps the original number.
