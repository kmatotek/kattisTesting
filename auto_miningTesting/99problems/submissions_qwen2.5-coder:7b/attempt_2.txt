Apologies for the oversight. Let's correct the logic for finding the closest number ending in 99. The original approach is almost correct, but it does not handle the case where `N` is exactly halfway between two multiples of 100 (i.e., when `N % 100 == 50`). In such cases, we should round up to the next multiple of 100 ending in 99.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Read input from standard input
N = int(input())

# Calculate the nearest number ending in 99
if N % 100 == 99:
    closest_number = N
elif N % 100 <= 50:
    closest_number = N - (N % 100)
else:
    closest_number = N + (100 - N % 100)

# Ensure the result ends in 99 if it's exactly halfway between two multiples of 100
if N % 100 == 50:
    closest_number += 50

# Print the result
print(closest_number)
```

This code should now correctly handle all cases and pass the test cases.
