I apologize for my mistake. It seems that my previous solutions did not work correctly.

Here is a new Python program that should pass all test cases:

```
def find_closest_ending_in_99():
    N = int(input())
    closest_number1 = (N // 100) * 100 + 99
    closest_number2 = ((N // 100) + 1) * 100 + 99

    if abs(closest_number1 - N) < abs(closest_number2 - N):
        print(closest_number1)
    else:
        print(closest_number2)

find_closest_ending_in_99()
```

This program calculates the closest number that ends in 99 by considering two cases: either `N` is already close to a number ending in 99, or it is far from such a number. It then prints out the closer of these two numbers.

I hope this solution works correctly and passes all test cases.
