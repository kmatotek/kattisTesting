Here is the Python program for this problem:

```
def find_closest_ending_in_99():
    N = int(input())
    closest_number = None
    diff1 = float('inf')
    diff2 = float('inf')

    for i in range(N-99, N+100):
        if i % 100 == 99:
            diff = abs(i - N)
            if diff < diff1:
                closest_number = i
                diff1 = diff
            elif diff == diff1:
                closest_number = max(closest_number, i)

    print(closest_number)

find_closest_ending_in_99()
```

This program reads an integer `N` from the standard input, and then iterates over all integers in the range `[N-99, N+100]`. It checks each number to see if it ends in 99. If it does, it calculates the absolute difference between that number and `N`, and updates the closest number and its corresponding difference if necessary. Finally, it prints out the closest number that ends in 99.
