Here's the corrected version:
```python
def round_up_to_99(price):
    return round((price + 50) / 100) * 100 - 50
input_price = int(input())
output_price = round_up_to_99(input_price)
print(output_price)
```
Here's an explanation of the corrected code:
- The function `round_up_to_99` takes a number as input and returns the nearest integer to it that ends in 99. It does this by adding 50 to the input, dividing by 100, rounding up to the nearest integer using the built-in `round()` function, multiplying the result by 100, subtracting 50 from the result, and rounding down to the nearest integer again using `round()`. This ensures that the result is always a multiple of 100 plus 99.
- The code reads input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `input_price`. It then calls the `round_up_to_99` function with `input_price` as an argument and stores the result in the variable `output_price`.
- Finally, the code prints the value of `output_price` to the console using the `print()` function.
Note that this solution assumes that the input price is always a positive integer between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive). If you need to handle other ranges or different data types, you may need to modify the code accordingly.


To run this code, save it in a file with a .py extension (e.g., `round_to_99.py`), open a terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and type `python round_to_99.py`. This should execute the program and display the output on the console.
