The problem is '99problems'. Your previous solution was:

```python
def closest_price_ending_in_99(N):
    lower_bound = (N // 100) * 100
    upper_bound = lower_bound + 100
    lower_closest = lower_bound + 99
    upper_closest = upper_bound - 1

    if N - lower_closest <= upper_closest - N:
        return lower_closest
    else:
        return upper_closest

# Reading input from standard input
N = int(input().strip())

# Finding the closest price ending in 99
result = closest_price_ending_in_99(N)

# Writing output to standard output
print(result)
```
It was incorrect. The error type was: Wrong Answer (0.04Â s). It passed 2 out of 19 test cases.  Additionally, your solution failed at least one of the sample test cases. Please review your code, identify the mistake, and provide a corrected version.
