The issue with the previous solution is that it fails to handle the case where `N` is a multiple of 100. In this case, the expression `ceil(N / 100) * 100 - 99` will give the same result as `floor(N / 100 + 1) * 100 - 99`, which is not what we want.

Here's a corrected version of the code:
```python
from math import ceil, floor

N = int(input())

# find the nearest number to N that is divisible by 100 and ends in 99
closest_number = (ceil(N / 100) * 100 - 99) if (ceil(N / 100) * 100 - 99) % 10 == 0 else (floor(N / 100 + 1) * 100 - 99)

print(closest_number)
```
This code uses the ternary operator `?` to check if the result of `ceil(N / 100) * 100 - 99` is a multiple of 10, and if so, returns that value. Otherwise, it returns the result of `floor(N / 100 + 1) * 100 - 99`.
