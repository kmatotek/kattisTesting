I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's correct the logic to ensure we always get the larger number if there's a tie.

The previous code was almost correct but did not handle the tie case properly, leading to an incorrect result in some scenarios. Specifically, if `price` is exactly halfway between two multiples of 100, the original code would return the lower multiple instead of the higher one as required.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

```python
# Read the input price from standard input
price = int(input())

# Calculate the lower multiple of 100 that is less than or equal to the given price
lower_multiple = (price // 100) * 100

# Calculate the upper multiple of 100 that is greater than the given price
upper_multiple = lower_multiple + 100

# Determine which multiple is closer to the given price
if price - lower_multiple <= upper_multiple - price:
    closest_price = lower_multiple if price - lower_multiple < upper_multiple - price else upper_multiple
else:
    closest_price = upper_multiple

# Print the closest price ending in 99
print(closest_price)
```

This corrected version ensures that if there's a tie (i.e., `price` is exactly halfway between two multiples of 100), the larger multiple (`upper_multiple`) will be chosen. This should correctly handle all provided test cases.
