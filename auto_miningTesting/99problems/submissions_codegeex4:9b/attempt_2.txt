The problem is '99problems'. Your previous solution was:

```python
def nearest_multiple_of_99(n):
    lower = (n // 100) * 100
    upper = lower + 100
    if abs(n - lower) <= abs(upper - n):
        return lower + 99
    else:
        return upper + 99

# Read input from standard input
n = int(input().strip())

# Get the nearest multiple of 99
result = nearest_multiple_of_99(n)

# Print the result to standard output
print(result)
```
It was incorrect. The error type was: You are out of submission tokens. Your next token will regenerate in 48 seconds.. No test cases were run due to an error.  Additionally, your solution failed at least one of the sample test cases. Please review your code, identify the mistake, and provide a corrected version.
