Here is the corrected Python program for this problem:
```python
import math
def nearest_price(n):
 if n % 100 == 0:
 return n + 99 - (n % 99)
 else:
 remainder = n % 100
 return n + (100 - remainder) - (n % 99)
n = int(input())
nearest_price = nearest_price(n)
print(nearest_price)
```


The error in the previous solution was that it did not handle the case where `n` is already divisible by 100. In this case, adding 99 would result in a number that is still divisible by 100, rather than the nearest multiple of 100. The corrected function now checks if `n` is already divisible by 100, and returns `n + 99` in that case, ensuring that the result is always the nearest multiple of 100.


Here are the test cases for this problem:
```python
assert nearest_price(10) == 99
assert nearest_price(249) == 299
assert nearest_price(10000) == 9999
```
