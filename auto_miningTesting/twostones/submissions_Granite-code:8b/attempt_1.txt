Here's the Python program for the problem:
```python
# Read input from standard input
N = int(input())
# Play optimally and Alice plays first
if N % 2 == 1:
 print("Alice")
else:
 print("Bob")
```
To run this program, save it to a file with a .py extension (e.g., stones.py) and execute it using the command `python stones.py`. Make sure you have Python installed on your system before running the program.
