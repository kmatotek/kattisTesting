Here is a Python program that solves the problem:

```Python
def find_winner():
    N = int(input())
    if N % 2 == 0:
        print("Bob")
    else:
        print("Alice")

find_winner()
```

This program asks for an integer input `N` from the user, checks whether it's even or odd using the modulus operator `%`, and then prints out "Bob" if `N` is even and "Alice" if `N` is odd.
