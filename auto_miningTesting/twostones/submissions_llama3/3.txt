Here is a Python program to solve this problem:

```Python
def stone_game(n):
    if n % 4 == 0:
        return "Bob"
    elif n % 4 == 1:
        return "Alice"
    elif n % 4 == 2:
        return "Bob"
    else:
        return "Alice"

n = int(input())
print(stone_game(n))
```

In this program, we define a function `stone_game` that takes an integer `n` as input. The function uses the modulo operator `%` to determine the winner based on the remainder of `n` divided by 4.

If `n % 4 == 0`, it means that the number of stones is divisible by 4, so Bob wins. If `n % 4 == 1`, Alice wins. If `n % 4 == 2`, again Bob wins, and if `n % 4 == 3`, Alice wins.

Finally, we read an integer from input using the built-in `input` function, convert it to an integer with `int()`, and then call our `stone_game` function with this number as argument. The result is printed out.
