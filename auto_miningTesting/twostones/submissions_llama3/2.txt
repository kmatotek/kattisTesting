Here is a Python program for this problem:

```Python
def find_winner(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return "Bob"
    else:
        return "Alice"

n = int(input())
print(find_winner(n))
```

This program defines a function `find_winner` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the winner, either "Alice" or "Bob". The function uses the fact that if the number of stones is even, then Bob wins, otherwise Alice wins. In the main part of the program, it reads an integer from the standard input, calls the `find_winner` function with this integer, and prints the result.

You can run this program in a Python environment and test it with different inputs to see if it produces the correct results.
