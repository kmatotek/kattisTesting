Here is the Python program for this problem:

```python
def stone_game(N):
    if N % 2 == 0:
        return "Bob"
    else:
        return "Alice"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    N = int(input())
    print(stone_game(N))
```
This program works by checking the remainder of dividing the number of stones (`N`) by 2. If it's 0, that means `N` is even and Bob wins since Alice will always take two stones from an even number. Otherwise, if `N` is odd, Alice wins.
