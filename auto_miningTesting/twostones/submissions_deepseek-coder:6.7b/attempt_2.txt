I apologize for the confusion earlier. The game "Alice and Bob in turns take exactly two consecutive stones on the ground until there are no consecutive stones on the ground" is known as Nim Game, where N = 2 corresponds to this situation. 

The strategy here is that if $N$ modulo $2$ equals zero (i.e., $N$ is even), Bob wins because Alice will always take two stones and leave an odd number of stones for Bob which he can then also take away. So the result should be "Bob". 

If $N$ isn't even, that means it ends in an odd number (i.e., $N$ is odd). Now if Alice takes one stone first, she leaves an even number of stones for Bob and he can win by taking two in his turn, so Alice should also take away the last stone to leave no stone for Bob. So Alice wins then, and the result should be "Alice".

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def stone_game(N):
    if N % 2 == 0:   # If N is even
        return 'Bob'
    else:            # If N is odd
        return 'Alice'
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    N = int(input())
    print(stone<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>t_game(N))
