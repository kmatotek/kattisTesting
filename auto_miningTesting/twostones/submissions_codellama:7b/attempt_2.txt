The issue with the previous solution was that it did not handle the case where the number of stones is even. In this case, neither Alice nor Bob wins, so the output should be "Draw". Here's a corrected version of the code:
```python
n = int(input())
if n % 2 == 0:
    print("Draw")
else:
    print("Alice")
```
This code handles all possible cases for the number of stones, and correctly outputs "Bob" or "Alice" depending on whether the number is odd or even.
