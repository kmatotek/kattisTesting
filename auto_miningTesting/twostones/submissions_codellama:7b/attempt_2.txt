The issue with the previous solution is that it did not handle the case where the number of stones is even and the number of consecutive pairs of stones is greater than 1. In such cases, Alice should win, but the code was outputting "Bob" as the winner.

Here's a corrected version of the code:
```python
n = int(input())
alice_count, bob_count = 0, 0
while n > 1:
    if n % 2 == 0 and n >= 3:
        n -= 2
        alice_count += 1
    else:
        n -= 2
        bob_count += 1
if alice_count > bob_count:
    print("Alice")
else:
    print("Bob")
```
This code takes into account the case where the number of stones is even and the number of consecutive pairs of stones is greater than 1. In such cases, Alice should win, so the code outputs "Alice" as the winner.
