I apologize for my earlier mistake. You are correct that I made a mistake in my previous solution. The problem you mentioned is 'twostones', which is about optimally deciding on a player to start in this game based on the total number of stones. The correct solution should be:

```python
N = int(input())

if N % 4 == 0 or N % 4 == 3:
    print("Alice")
else:
    print("Bob")
```
This program reads an integer `N` from standard input, checks if `N` is divisible by 4 or 3, and then outputs "Alice" if it's true, otherwise it outputs "Bob".

The reason this works is that Alice will start the game with two stones and win in a forced manner. If N is even and not divisible by 4, Alice can force a win by taking two more stones (N+2) to bring the total to a multiple of 4, making Bob take the last remaining stone (N+1). If N is odd and not divisible by 3, Alice can also force a win by taking another one (N+1) to make Bob's first move on an even numbered board. this works because both players play optimally. Therefore, if either of these conditions is true, the game will end with Alice being the winner. Otherwise, Bob will be the winner.
