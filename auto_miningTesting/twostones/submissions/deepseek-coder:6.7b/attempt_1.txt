The problem is about nim game and nimbers. In the context of this game, a position with an even number of stones (n) has Bob as the winner because there are no winning moves for Alice: she can only remove one stone to leave either 0 or an odd number of stones that will be won by Bob. A position with an odd number of stones has Alice as the winner.

Here is a Python program based on this understanding:

```python
def game_winner(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return "Bob"
    else:
        return "Alice"

# read input from standard input
n = int(input().strip())
print(game_winner(n))
```
This program reads an integer `n` from the standard input, and then prints either "Alice" or "Bob" based on whether `n` is even or odd. The function `game_winner()` takes an argument `n` (the number of stones) and returns a string indicating who the winner is based on the rules of the game.
