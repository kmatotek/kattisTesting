Thank you for bringing this to my attention. The issue with the previous solution was that it did not handle input correctly. Here's a corrected version of the program that reads input from standard input using `input()` and writes output using `print()`. The code is completely self-contained and can be executed directly:
```python
def main():
 input_string = input("Enter a string: ")
 print(f"Hello, {input_string}!")
if __name__ == "__main__":
 main()
```
This program defines a function called `main` that prompts the user to enter a string, and then prints "Hello, [input string]!" to the console. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module in another script.
