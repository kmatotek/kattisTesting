Write a Python program for this problem. Ensure that your solution reads input from standard input using input() and writes output to standard output using print(). Do not include any hardcoded test cases or example inputs in your code. The code should be a complete, runnable program that can be executed directly. Make sure that the variables' names and functions' names are different, and also only use internal Python libraries, not external ones:

Input:
There is no input for this problem.

Output:
