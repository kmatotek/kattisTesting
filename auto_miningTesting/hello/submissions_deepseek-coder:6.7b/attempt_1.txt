Sure, here is a simple Python program that meets your requirements:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

This program will print "Hello World" when it runs. As there's no input required for this problem, we don't use the `input()` function. The output is achieved using the `print()` function. All variables and functions names are unique, as per Python naming conventions and only internal Python libraries were used.
