Here is a simple Python program that reads input from standard input (although there is no actual input for this problem) and writes "Hello World!" to the output:

```python
def main():
    print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You can run this program directly, and it will output "Hello World!".
