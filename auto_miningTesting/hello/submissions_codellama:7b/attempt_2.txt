I apologize for the confusion. Here is the correct solution:
```python
import sys

def main():
    print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This code will output "Hello World!" to the console. The `print()` function is used to display the string on the screen. The `__name__` variable is a special Python variable that holds the name of the current module or script being executed. In this case, the value of `__name__` is `"__main__"`. When a Python script is run directly (i.e., not imported as a module), the value of `__name__` is set to `"__main__"` and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is executed. In this case, it calls the `main()` function, which in turn prints the string "Hello World!".
