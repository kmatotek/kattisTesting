This solution uses a simple iterative algorithm to simulate the game of Frogger. It reads in the input from standard input, and then uses a loop to iterate over the board squares until the frog encounters one of the four fates (magic number, left end, right end, or cycle). The hop count is incremented each time the frog moves, and it is used to determine the fate of the frog. If the frog encounters a magic number, the program prints "magic" and the hop count. Otherwise, if the frog falls off one end of the board, it prints "left" or "right", depending on which end it fell off, and the hop count. If the frog is trapped in a cycle, it prints "cycle" and the hop count.
