Here's a Python program that plays the Frogger game using the rules given in the problem description:
```python
def play_frogger(n, s, m, board):
    visited = [False] * n # keep track of which squares have been visited
    current_square = s - 1 # convert index to zero-based index
    num_hops = 0 # keep track of the number of hops
    
    while True:
        if current_square < 0 or current_square >= n:
            return 'left' if current_square < 0 else 'right', num_hops
        if board[current_square] == m:
            return 'magic', num_hops
        if visited[current_square]:
            return 'cycle', num_hops
        
        visited[current_square] = True
        
        jump_distance = board[current_square]
        current_square += jump_distance
        num_hops += 1
```
Here's how you can run the program:
```python
n, s, m = map(int, input().split()) # read the input from standard input
board = list(map(int, input().split())) # read the board squares from standard input
fate, num_hops = play_frogger(n, s, m, board) # play the game and get the fate and number of hops
print(fate) # print the fate to standard output
print(num_hops) # print the number of hops to standard output
```
Note that this program assumes that the input is valid and follows the rules given in the problem description. It also assumes that the starting square is a valid index on the board, i.e., $1 \leq s \leq n$. If these assumptions are not met, the program may produce unexpected results or crash.
