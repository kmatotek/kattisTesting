The problem with my previous solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the case where the frog reaches its magic number without moving. This can happen when the starting position contains the magic number.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```Python
import sys

def get_frog_fate(n, s, m, board):
    frog_pos = s
    hop_count = 0
    while True:
        if board[frog_pos-1] == m:
            return 'magic', hop_count
        elif abs(board[frog_pos-1]) > 0:
            for i in range(1, abs(board[frog_pos-1])):
                frog_pos += 1 if board[frog_pos-1] > 0 else -1
        if set([frog_pos]) in [[i for i in range(1, n+1)]]:
            return 'cycle', hop_count + (abs(frog_pos - s) * (board[s-1] < 0))
        elif frog_pos <= 1:
            return 'left', hop_count
        elif frog_pos >= n:
            return 'right', hop_count

n, s, m = map(int, input().split())
board = list(map(int, input().split()))
fate, hops = get_frog_fate(n, s, m, board)
print(fate)
print(hops)
```

In this corrected version, we check if the frog reaches its magic number in each step. If it does, we return 'magic' with the current hop count.

We also correctly handle the case where the starting position contains the magic number by returning 'magic' without any hops.

Finally, we adjust the hop count when the frog encounters a cycle to account for any initial movement towards or away from the starting position.
