The issue with your previous solution is that it does not handle the case where the frog lands on a square containing the magic number, but the player has already visited all the squares on the board before encountering the fate of falling off the left or right end of the board, or encountering a cycle. In such cases, the program should return "magic" as the fate and the number of hops made before reaching that fate.

Here is a corrected version of your solution:
```python
import sys
from collections import deque

def frogger(n, s, m):
    board = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pos = s
    moves = 0
    seen = set()
    while True:
        if pos == m:
            return "magic", moves
        elif pos < 1 or pos > n:
            return "right" if pos < 1 else "left", moves
        elif board[pos] < 0:
            pos += board[pos]
        else:
            moves += board[pos]
            seen.add(pos)
            pos = (pos + 1) % n
        if len(seen) == n and pos != m:
            return "magic", moves
```
In this corrected version, I added an additional condition to the `if` statement that checks if the frog has already visited all the squares on the board before encountering the fate of falling off the left or right end of the board, or encountering a cycle. If both conditions are true, the program returns "magic" as the fate and the number of hops made before reaching that fate.
