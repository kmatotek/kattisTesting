This program uses a deque to keep track of the positions that the frog has been in, and checks if it has visited all the squares on the board before determining that the frog is trapped in a cycle. If the frog encounters one of the four fates (magic number, falling off the left or right end of the board, or encountering a cycle), it returns the corresponding fate and the number of hops made before reaching that fate. The input is taken from standard input using `input()`, and the output is printed to standard output using `print()`.
