```python
def frogger_game(n, s, m, board):
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    position = s
    hops = 0
    
    while True:
        if visited[position]:
            fate = 'cycle'
            break
        visited[position] = True
        
        if board[position - 1] == m:
            fate = 'magic'
            break
        elif position == 1 and board[0] < 0:
            fate = 'left'
            break
        elif position == n and board[n - 1] > 0:
            fate = 'right'
            break
        
        if board[position - 1] > 0:
            position += board[position - 1]
        else:
            position -= abs(board[position - 1])
        
        hops += 1
    
    return fate, hops

# Read input
n, s, m = map(int, input().split())
board = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Get the result
fate, hops = frogger_game(n, s, m, board)

# Print output
print(fate)
print(hops)
```

This Python program reads the input values for `n`, `s`, and `m` from standard input using the `input()` function. It then reads the list of board squares into the `board` list. The `frogger_game` function is called with these inputs to determine the frog's fate and the number of hops made before encountering its fate. Finally, the program prints the fate and the number of hops according to the specified output format.
