The previous solution is logically sound but might have missed some edge cases or small details in handling the board movements and fate conditions.

Let's re-examine and correct the logic to ensure it handles all scenarios correctly:

1. **Board Indexing**: Ensure that indices are correctly handled.
2. **Fate Conditions**: Make sure all conditions for winning, losing, or cycling are properly checked.
3. **Position Calculation**: Handle both positive (right) and negative (left) movements correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def frogger_game(n, s, m, board):
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    position = s
    hops = 0
    
    while True:
        if visited[position]:
            fate = 'cycle'
            break
        
        visited[position] = True
        
        if board[position - 1] == m:
            fate = 'magic'
            break
        elif position == 1 and board[0] < 0:
            fate = 'left'
            break
        elif position == n and board[n - 1] > 0:
            fate = 'right'
            break
        
        if board[position - 1] > 0:
            new_position = position + board[position - 1]
        else:
            new_position = position - abs(board[position - 1])
        
        # Check if the new position is out of bounds
        if not (1 <= new_position <= n):
            fate = 'left' if board[position - 1] < 0 else 'right'
            break
        
        position = new_position
        hops += 1
    
    return fate, hops

# Read input
n, s, m = map(int, input().split())
board = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Get the result
fate, hops = frogger_game(n, s, m, board)

# Print output
print(fate)
print(hops)
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
1. **Board Indexing**: The `position` is directly used in the loop without any adjustments.
2. **Fate Conditions**:
   - If the frog reaches a position where the board value is equal to `m`, it wins (`fate = 'magic'`).
   - If the frog reaches the left or right end of the board, it loses with the corresponding fate (`fate = 'left'` or `fate = 'right'`).
   - If the frog revisits a position, it cycles (`fate = 'cycle'`).
3. **Position Calculation**: The new position is calculated based on whether the move is right (positive) or left (negative).
4. **Out of Bounds Check**: Ensure that the new position stays within valid bounds. If not, determine the fate based on the direction of movement.

This should address any potential issues and ensure all test cases are passed for the problem "1dfroggereasy".
