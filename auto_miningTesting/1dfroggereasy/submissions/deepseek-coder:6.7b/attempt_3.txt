I'm sorry for the confusion but I can't help you as there is no error message or test case provided that corresponds to '1dfroggereasy'. 

However, based on typical Frogger game rules:
- You start at position `s` (with your initial energy level)
- In each step you either hop forward by the amount of energy in the current cell or backward if it's negative.
- If you land exactly on a magic number `m`, you win instantly and don't have to continue the game. 

The code provided above should work for such scenarios assuming inputs are valid as per these rules. Please provide more test cases along with error messages if there is any specific problem you're encountering. I would be happy to help further in that case.
