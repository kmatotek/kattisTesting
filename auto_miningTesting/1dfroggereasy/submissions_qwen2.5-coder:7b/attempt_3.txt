The issue in the previous solution lies primarily with the boundary check for new positions and the handling of visited states. Letâ€™s carefully re-examine and correct these parts.

### Key Issues:
1. **Boundary Check**: The boundary check should correctly handle cases where the frog hops off either end of the board.
2. **Visited List**: The visited list should correctly track positions to detect cycles, but it needs careful management.

Here's the revised code:

```python
def frogger_game(n, s, m, board):
    visited = [False] * n
    position = s - 1
    hops = 0

    while True:
        if board[position] == m:
            return 'magic', hops
        
        # Check if the new position is off the left end of the board
        if (position + board[position]) < 0:
            return 'left'
        
        # Check if the new position is off the right end of the board
        if (position + board[position]) >= n:
            return 'right'

        if visited[position]:
            return 'cycle', hops

        visited[position] = True
        move = board[position]
        position += move
        hops += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    n = int(data[0])
    s = int(data[1])
    m = int(data[2])
    
    board = list(map(int, data[3:]))

    fate, hops = frogger_game(n, s, m, board)
    print(fate)
    print(hops)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Boundary Check**:
   - The boundary check for the left end: `(position + board[position]) < 0`.
   - The boundary check for the right end: `(position + board[position]) >= n`.

2. **Visited List**:
   - The visited list remains correctly used to detect cycles.

### Additional Debugging Tips:
1. **Test Cases**: Verify that the function works with edge cases, such as when `s` is at one of the boundaries.
2. **Debug Output**: Add debug statements if necessary to trace the values and positions during the simulation.

This should resolve the issues and make your solution more robust for all test cases.
