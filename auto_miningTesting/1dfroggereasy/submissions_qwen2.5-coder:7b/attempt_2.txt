Certainly! The issue in the previous solution lies in the handling of board indices and the boundary conditions. Specifically, when calculating the new position after a hop, we need to ensure that it stays within the valid range of indices. Additionally, the way the visited list is managed should be re-evaluated.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the code:

```python
def frogger_game(n, s, m, board):
    visited = [False] * n
    position = s - 1
    hops = 0

    while True:
        if board[position] == m:
            return 'magic', hops
        
        if hops >= len(board) or (position + board[position]) < 0 or (position + board[position]) >= n:
            if (position + board[position]) < 0:
                return 'left'
            else:
                return 'right'
        
        if visited[position]:
            return 'cycle', hops

        visited[position] = True
        move = board[position]
        position += move
        hops += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    n = int(data[0])
    s = int(data[1])
    m = int(data[2])
    
    board = list(map(int, data[3:]))

    fate, hops = frogger_game(n, s, m, board)
    print(fate)
    print(hops)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Boundary Check for New Position**:
   - The new position is calculated as `position + move`, where `move` is the value in the current square.
   - The boundary check now correctly ensures that the new position stays within `[0, n-1]`.

2. **Handling Off-Board Conditions**:
   - If the new position is negative, it means the frog falls off the left end of the board, and the function returns `'left'`.
   - If the new position is greater than or equal to `n`, it means the frog falls off the right end of the board, and the function returns `'right'`.

3. **Visited List**:
   - The visited list is correctly used to detect cycles.

This should resolve the issues that caused the previous code to fail some test cases.
