apologize for the confusion. The provided Python script appears correct based on its purpose as it seems to implement the Frogger game logic correctly. It does not seem like there is any syntactical or logical errors in the script itself. 

The issue might be with the input you provide when running this code. For instance, if your inputs are incorrectly formatted (e.g., they don't match the expected format), this can cause an error. The program also relies on correctness of the number of tokens and their sequence, as well as values in squares array and magic_num value. 

Without more specific information about the exact input/output or any errors you encountered, it's hard to give a more detailed answer. If this is not the case, please provide these details so that I could help you better.
