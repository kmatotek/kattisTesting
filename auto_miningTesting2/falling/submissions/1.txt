Here is a Python program for the problem:

```python
def find_frames(D):
    n1 = 0
    while True:
        n2 = n1 + 1
        if n2 * n2 - n1 * n1 > D:
            return "impossible"
        elif n2 * n2 - n1 * n1 == D:
            return n1, n2
        else:
            n1 += 1


D = int(input())
n1, n2 = find_frames(D)
if n1 == "impossible":
    print("impossible")
else:
    print(n1, n2)
```

In this program, we define a function find_frames which keeps iterating until it either finds two non-negative integers n1 and n2 such that n2 * n2 - n1 * n1 equals to D, or till n2 * n2 - n1 * n1 becomes more than D. If the latter happens, it means it is impossible to find two such non-negative integers and hence it returns "impossible". The main part of the program inputs the value of D and calls the find_frames function. If find_frames returns "impossible", it simply prints "impossible". Otherwise it prints the two non-negative integers.
