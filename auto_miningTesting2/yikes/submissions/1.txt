Here is a Python program that meets your specifications.

```python
def problem_set_solution():
    N = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(N):
        MAX_SPEED = float(input().strip())
        BICYCLE_SPEED = float(input().strip())
        DISTANCE = float(input().strip())
        START_TIME = float(input().strip())

        time_to_cross_road = 10 / MAX_SPEED
        distance_of_bike_from_dash_line = BICYCLE_SPEED * START_TIME
        distance_of_bike_from_finish_line = DISTANCE - distance_of_bike_from_dash_line
        
        if  BICYCLE_SPEED > 0 and (distance_of_bike_from_finish_line / BICYCLE_SPEED) < time_to_cross_road:
            print("Max beats the first bicycle")
        else:
            time_to_next_bike_arrival = (4 / BICYCLE_SPEED)
            collided_with = (time_to_cross_road - (distance_of_bike_from_finish_line / BICYCLE_SPEED)) // time_to_next_bike_arrival + 1
            
            if collided_with < 1 or collided_with > 10:
                print("Max crosses safely after bicycle", str(int(collided_with)))
            else:
                print("Collision with bicycle", str(int(collided_with)))

problem_set_solution()                
```

This program processes each problem by first interpreting the input, determining Max's time to cross the road and the bicycle times to reach the dash line and then finish line. Then, the program compares these times and prints the appropriate output accordingly.

Please note that this solution assumes cycling is continuous to progress during his dash attempt. If an instant stop for cyclists is assumed, the solution would differ. 

This program should be run in a environment where input can be provided, like a terminal or command prompt. 

You may replace the `input().strip()` statements with array-like data structure, if you want to run the program without user-input specified in real-time.
