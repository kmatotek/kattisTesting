**Explanation:**

1. **`calculate_distance(junction1, junction2)`:**
   - This function calculates the Euclidean distance between two junctions, representing the cost of installing a pipe between them.

2. **`find_lowest_cost_path(junctions, pipes, source, destination)`:**
   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** This function implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest (lowest cost) path from the `source` junction to the `destination` junction in a graph.
   - **Data Structures:**
     - `distances`: A list to store the minimum cost to reach each junction from the source. Initialized with infinity for all junctions except the source.
     - `visited`: A list to keep track of visited junctions.
     - `previous`: A list to store the previous junction in the shortest path found so far.
   - **Algorithm Steps:**
     1. **Initialization:** Set the distance to the `source` to 0.
     2. **Iterate:** Repeat the following `num_junctions` times:
        - Find the unvisited junction with the smallest tentative distance (`min_distance`).
        - Mark this junction as visited.
        - For each unvisited neighbor of the current junction:
          - Calculate the cost to reach the neighbor through the current junction.
          - If this cost is less than the current tentative distance to the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and set its previous junction to the current junction.
     3. **Path Reconstruction:** After Dijkstra's algorithm, check if the destination was reached. If so, backtrack from the destination using the `previous` list to reconstruct the shortest path.
   - **Cost Calculation:** Calculate the total cost of the path by summing the distances between junctions and adding the cost of plugging holes (0.5 per hole) along the path, including at the source and destination.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The code reads the input case by case.
   - For each case, it stores the junction information (coordinates and number of holes) in the `junctions` list and the existing pipes in the `pipes` set.
   - It then calls `find_lowest_cost_path` to find the lowest cost solution and prints the result for each case.

**Key Improvements:**

- **Clear Function and Variable Names:** The code uses descriptive names like `calculate_distance`, `find_lowest_cost_path`, `junctions`, `pipes`, making it easier to understand.
- **Comments:** Comments explain the purpose of different code sections.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** The core logic for finding the shortest path is implemented using Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a standard and efficient solution for this type of problem.
- **Input Handling and Output Formatting:** The code handles input and output according to the problem specifications.

This improved solution is more readable, efficient, and follows good coding practices, making it a well-structured and maintainable Python program for the water transport problem.
