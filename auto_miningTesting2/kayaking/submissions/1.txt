Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def max_kayak_speed(b, n, e, sb, sn, se, cs):
    cs.sort()
    strengths = [sb]*b + [sn]*n + [se]*e
    strengths.sort()
    result = []

    while strengths:
        if len(strengths) == 1:
            result.append(cs.pop() * strengths.pop())
        else:
            max_strength = strengths.pop()
            min_strength = strengths.pop(0)
            result.append(cs.pop() * (max_strength + min_strength))

    return min(result)


# Testing the function
print(max_kayak_speed(2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]))
```

In this program, we first sort the speed factors `cs` of the canoes. Next, we create a sorted list `strengths` of all the strength values of the participants. The strength list is created by repeating the strength of beginners `sb` 'b' times, the strength of normal participants `sn` 'n' times, and the strength of experienced participants `se` 'e' times. After sorting, we have a list with the weakest participants first and the strongest participants last.

We then start a while loop that continues until the list `strengths` is depleted. If there is only one participant left in `strengths`, we get the speed of their canoe by multiplying the speed factor of the fastest remaining canoe (popped from `cs` using `cs.pop()`) with the strength of the only remaining participant (popped from `strengths` using `strengths.pop()`). This value is appended to a list of results `result`.

If there are more than one participant left in `strengths`, we take the strength of the strongest remaining participant (`max_strength`) and the strength of the weakest remaining participant (`min_strength`). We then calculate the speed of their canoe by summing their strengths and multiplying with the speed factor of the fastest remaining canoe. This value is then appended to the list of results `result`.

At the end of the program, we return the minimum value from the `result` list. Since the speed of the group is determined by the speed of the slowest canoe, we need to find the minimum speed that can be achieved through this distribution of paddlers in the canoes.
