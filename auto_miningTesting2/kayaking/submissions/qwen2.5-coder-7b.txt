Here is a Python program that solves the problem using internal Python libraries. The function `max_kayak_speed` takes in the number of beginners, normal participants, experienced kayakers, their strengths, and the speed factors for each kayak as input, and returns the maximum speed of the slowest kayak.

```python
def max_kayak_speed(b, n, e, sb, sn, se, c):
    participants = sorted([sb]*b + [sn]*n + [se]*e)
    kayaks = sorted(c)

    # Initialize the total speed to 0
    total_speed = 0

    # Distribute participants and calculate the total speed
    for i in range(len(kayaks)):
        if i < b:
            total_speed += (participants[i] + participants[b+i]) * kayaks[i]
        elif i < b+n:
            total_speed += (participants[b+n+i-b-1] + participants[b+n+i]) * kayaks[i]
        else:
            total_speed += (participants[-2] + participants[-1]) * kayaks[i]

    # Return the maximum speed
    return max(kayaks) * (sum(participants[:b]) + sum(participants[b:b+n]) + sum(participants[-n:]))

# Read input values
b, n, e = map(int, input().split())
sb, sn, se = map(int, input().split())
c = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Print the maximum speed of the slowest kayak
print(max_kayak_speed(b, n, e, sb, sn, se, c))
```

Here's a brief explanation of how the function works:

1. We first sort the participants by their strengths in ascending order and the kayaks by their speed factors in ascending order.
2. We initialize `total_speed` to 0, which will store the total speed of all kayaks.
3. We then distribute the participants into pairs for each kayak.
   - For beginners, we pair them with normal participants or other beginners.
   - For normal participants, we pair them with other normal participants or experienced kayakers.
   - For experienced kayakers, we pair them with other experienced kayakers.
4. For each kayak, we calculate its speed as the sum of the strengths of two people in the kayak multiplied by the speed factor of the kayak and add it to `total_speed`.
5. Finally, we return the maximum value between the speed factors of the kayaks and the total speed.

The program reads input values using the `input()` function, which takes a string from the standard input (keyboard) as an argument and returns it as a string. The `split()` method splits the string into a list of substrings separated by whitespace characters.
The `map()` function applies a given function to each element in an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object, which is then converted back to a list using the `list()` function.

Note that this program assumes that the input values are valid according to the problem statement. If invalid input values may be provided, additional error checking should be added.
