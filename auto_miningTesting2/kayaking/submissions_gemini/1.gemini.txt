**Explanation:**

1. **Input:**
   - Reads the number of beginners, normal, and expert paddlers.
   - Reads the individual strengths of each type of paddler.
   - Reads the speed factors of each canoe.

2. **`calculate_optimal_speed` Function:**
   - Sorts the canoe speeds in ascending order (to pair faster canoes with potentially weaker teams).
   - Systematically calculates all possible combinations of paddlers' strengths, prioritizing:
     - Pairing experts together.
     - Pairing remaining experts with beginners, then with normal paddlers.
     - Pairing normal paddlers together.
     - Pairing remaining normal paddlers with beginners.
     - Pairing beginners together.
   - Sorts the combined strengths in descending order to prioritize assigning stronger teams to slower canoes.
   - Iterates through the canoes and their corresponding combined strengths, calculating the speed of each canoe.
   - Keeps track of the minimum speed encountered, representing the speed of the slowest canoe.

3. **Output:**
   - Prints the calculated maximum speed of the slowest canoe.

**Key Idea:**

The algorithm aims to maximize the overall speed by strategically pairing paddlers and assigning them to canoes. It prioritizes placing stronger pairs in slower canoes to balance out the speeds and ensure that no canoe is significantly slower than others.
