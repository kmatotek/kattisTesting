Here is a python solution for your problem:

```python
import sys, heapq

def postal_service(N, K, deliveries):
    left = []
    right = []
    deliveries = sorted(deliveries)
    for pos, letters in deliveries:
        if pos < 0:
            left.append((pos, letters))
        else:
            right.append((pos, letters))

    left = left[::-1]
    distance = 0
    while left:
        pos, letters = left.pop()
        distance += 2 * abs(pos) * ((letters + K - 1)//K)
        if letters % K != 0 and left and left[-1][1] <= K - letters % K:
            extra, = heapq.heappushpop(left, ((pos, letters%K)))
            left.append((pos, extra))
    
    while right:
        pos, letters = right.pop()
        distance += 2 * abs(pos) * ((letters + K - 1)//K)
        if letters % K != 0 and right and right[-1][1] <= K - letters % K:
            extra, = heapq.heappushpop(right, ((pos, letters%K)))
            right.append((pos, extra))

    return distance

def main():
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    deliveries = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]
    result = postal_service(N, K, deliveries)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution first sorts the deliveries into two lists: `left` for the deliveries with negative positions and `right` for the deliveries with non-negative positions. It then processes each delivery in each list in turn, calculating the distance traveled for each delivery, and bundles the deliveries together when doing so reduces the total distance traveled. The result is the minimum total travel distance needed to deliver all the letters and return to the post office.
