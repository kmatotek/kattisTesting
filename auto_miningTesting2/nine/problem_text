How many positive $d$


Input
The first line of the input consists of a single integer,
$T$, the number of test
cases.
Each of the following $T$
cases consists of a single integer $d$, the number of digits.


$1 \leq T \leq
20$


$1 \leq d \leq
10^{18}$


Output
For each test case, output the number of positive numbers
with $d$ digits that do
not contain a nine. Since this number can be very large, output
it modulo $1\, 000\, 000\,
007$.
