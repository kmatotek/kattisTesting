Here is a Python solution for your problem. This solution finds all possible triples and keeps track of how many days would it take for each islander to know about their triple. The final result is the maximum of these values. The complexity of this solution is O(n^2).

```python
def number_of_meetings(n, hats):
    t, p = [0]*32, [0]*32
    xor = [0]*32

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(25, -1, -1):
            if (((hats[i]>>j)&1) > 0):
                if (t[j] > 0):
                    xor[i] = max(xor[i], p[j] + 2)
                t[j], p[j] = t[j] + 1, i

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if t[hats[i] ^ hats[j]] > 2:
                xor[i] = max(xor[i], 3)
                xor[j] = max(xor[j], 3)

    return max(xor)


n = int(input().strip())
hats = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(n)]

print(number_of_meetings(n, hats))
```
In this Python program, we first create lists `t`, `p` and `xor`. The list `t` maintains the count of bits which are `1` in the given numbers. The list `p` stores the last position where the a bit is `1`. The `xor` list will store the maximum number of days it will take for each islander to know that they are part of a triple.

With the help of nested loops, we iterate through the input array once and for each query we iterates from most significant bit (MSB) to least significant bit (LSB) and if the current bit in query array is `1`, we increment the count of bits which are `1`. If there is at least one bit in `t` which is `1`, we update the number of days it will take for the current islander according to last position where a bit is `1` and store the current position where the bit is `1`.

In the end, we again use nested loops and if there are more than two bits which are `1` in the position calculated by xor of two numbers, we update the number of days it will take for the current pair of islanders. And finally, the answer would be maximum number of days it will take for an islander from `xor` list.
