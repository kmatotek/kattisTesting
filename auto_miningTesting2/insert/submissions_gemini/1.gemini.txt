**Explanation:**

1. **Node Structure:**
   - The code defines a `TreeNode` class to represent nodes in the BST. Each node stores its data, a left child reference, and a right child reference.

2. **Building the BST:**
   - The `build_bst` function takes a list of elements as input and constructs the BST. 
   - It creates the root node with the first element and iterates through the rest, inserting them into the tree using the `insert_node` function.

3. **Inserting a Node:**
   - The `insert_node` function recursively finds the appropriate position for a new element in the BST based on its value relative to the current node. 
   - It creates a new node when it reaches a missing subtree.

4. **Counting Permutations:**
   - The `count_permutations` function recursively calculates the number of permutations that result in the same BST structure. 
   - It does this by considering the following:
     - If the tree is empty, there's only one permutation (an empty sequence).
     - It recursively counts permutations for the left and right subtrees.
     - It calculates the binomial coefficient (n choose k), representing the number of ways to interleave the left and right subtree elements, where 'n' is the total number of elements in both subtrees and 'k' is the number of elements in the left subtree.
     - The final count is obtained by multiplying the binomial coefficient, the count of left subtree permutations, and the count of right subtree permutations.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The main part of the code reads input trees one by one until it encounters a line with '0'.
   - For each tree, it builds the BST, calculates the permutation count using `count_permutations`, and prints the result.

**Key Improvements:**
- **Clear Function and Variable Names:** The code uses descriptive names like `build_bst`, `insert_node`, and `count_permutations` to improve readability and understanding. 
- **Internal Libraries Only:** The solution relies solely on built-in Python libraries, making it self-contained and avoiding external dependencies.
- **Modular Design:** The code is organized into functions, making it more modular and easier to test or modify different parts.
- **Comments:** Comments are strategically added to explain the logic and reasoning behind the code.
