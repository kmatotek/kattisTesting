 Python program that uses no external libraries to solve this problem. The program takes as input a list of list or a 2-dimensional array of 9 numbers where each list or sub-array is the numbers in each line.

In the program, a grid of coordinates is created in the 'coordinates' variable that maps each number to its coordinates on the grid. The 'total_distance' function takes two coordinates and calculates the Euclidian distance between them. This function is then used to calculate the total distance of the pattern.
