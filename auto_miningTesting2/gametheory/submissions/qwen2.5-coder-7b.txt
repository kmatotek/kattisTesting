The problem you've presented is a classic example of a game theory problem where two players (you and SoCCat) are competing to maximize or minimize the score based on the rules given. To solve this, we need to analyze each position on the board and determine the optimal moves for both players.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem:

1. **Understand the Rules**: The game involves moving a token along an array of `n` cells. Each cell has a number associated with it (`p[i]`) and another value (`a[i]`) that contributes to the score when the token lands on it.

2. **Optimal Play**: Both players will play optimally, meaning they will make moves that maximize their score if they are you and minimize it if they are SoCCat.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems (i.e., the maximum or minimum score starting from a given cell).

4. **Iterate Over All Starting Positions**: For each possible starting position `s` (from 1 to n), calculate the final score assuming both players play optimally.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:

```python
def optimal_game_score(n, p, a):
    # Initialize DP arrays for maximum and minimum scores
    dp_max = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp_min = [0] * (n + 1)

    def max_score(x):
        if dp_max[x] != 0:
            return dp_max[x]
        
        # Calculate the maximum score starting from cell x
        max_val = float('-inf')
        for k in range(p[x-1], n-x+1, p[x-1]):
            max_val = max(max_val, a[x-1] + min_score(x+k))
        
        dp_max[x] = max_val
        return dp_max[x]

    def min_score(x):
        if dp_min[x] != 0:
            return dp_min[x]
        
        # Calculate the minimum score starting from cell x
        min_val = float('inf')
        for k in range(p[x-1], n-x+1, p[x-1]):
            min_val = min(min_val, max_score(x+k))
        
        dp_min[x] = min_val
        return dp_min[x]

    # Calculate the final score for each starting position
    results = []
    for s in range(1, n + 1):
        results.append(max_score(s))

    return results

# Read input
C = int(input())
results = []

for _ in range(C):
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    result = optimal_game_score(n, p, a)
    results.extend(result)

# Output the results
for result in results:
    print(" ".join(map(str, result)))
```

### Explanation:

1. **DP Arrays**: `dp_max` stores the maximum score starting from each cell, and `dp_min` stores the minimum score.

2. **Recursive Functions**:
   - `max_score(x)`: Calculates the maximum score starting from cell `x`.
   - `min_score(x)`: Calculates the minimum score starting from cell `x`.

3. **Dynamic Programming**: Both functions use memoization to store already computed results, avoiding redundant calculations.

4. **Main Loop**: For each test case, we read the input values and call `optimal_game_score` to get the results for all possible starting positions.

5. **Output**: We print the results for all test cases.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal scores for all starting positions using dynamic programming.
