**Explanation:**

1. **`calculate_final_score(num_cells, cell_values, score_values)` Function:**
   - Takes the number of cells, cell values, and score values as input.
   - Initializes `final_scores` list with -1, which serves as a flag to check if the optimal score from a particular cell has already been calculated or not.
   - Calls the `get_optimal_score` function to calculate the optimal score for each starting cell.
   - Returns the calculated `final_scores` for starting cells 1 to `n`.

2. **`get_optimal_score(current_cell)` Function:**
   - This is a recursive function to determine the optimal score from a given cell (`current_cell`).
   - **Base Cases:**
     - If `current_cell` is beyond the last cell (`current_cell > num_cells`), return 0 (game ends).
     - If the optimal score for the `current_cell` is already calculated (`final_scores[current_cell] != -1`), return the stored value.
   - **Recursive Step:**
     - Iterate through possible jumps (`jump`) based on the current cell's value (`cell_values[current_cell - 1]`).
     - Calculate the `next_cell` based on the jump.
     - If `next_cell` is valid (within the board), recursively calculate the `opponent_score` using `get_optimal_score`.
     - Update `max_score` to maximize the player's score.
   - Store the calculated `max_score` in `final_scores` for later use.
   - Return the calculated `max_score`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the input (number of cells, cell values, and score values).
   - Calls the `calculate_final_score` function to get the final scores for all starting positions.
   - Prints the space-separated results for each test case.

**Key Points:**

- **Optimal Play (Minimax Strategy):** The code implements a recursive approach to simulate optimal play by both players. The `get_optimal_score` function implicitly uses a minimax strategy, where the current player aims to maximize their score assuming the opponent will play optimally to minimize it. 
- **Memoization (Dynamic Programming):** The `final_scores` list is used to store already computed results (`memoization`). This prevents redundant calculations for the same cell and significantly improves efficiency. 

This solution provides an efficient way to solve SoCCat's game by leveraging recursion and memoization.
