Here's a Python program to solve the problem:

```python
def zoo_inventory():
    test_case = 1
    while True:
        n = int(input())
        if n == 0:
            break
        
        animals = {}
        
        for _ in range(n):
            animal_name = input()
            # Splitting the animal name and taking the last part as the type of animal
            parts = animal_name.split()
            animal_type = parts[-1].lower()
            
            # Counting the occurrences of each type of animal
            if animal_type in animals:
                animals[animal_type] += 1
            else:
                animals[animal_type] = 1
        
        print(f"List {test_case}:")
        for animal, count in sorted(animals.items()):
            print(f"{animal} | {count}")
        
        test_case += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    zoo_inventory()
```

This program reads the input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the output as required. It uses a dictionary to count occurrences of each type of animal, sorts the animals alphabetically, and formats the output accordingly.

The variable names and function names have been changed from those in the original code snippet.
