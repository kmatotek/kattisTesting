Zapray recently did not have much time to finish his
homework due to his addiction to Pokemon. What is even worse,
this week’s algorithm class has assigned a very challenging
homework problem: “Given an array of integers, find the longest
consecutive sub-array so that each element in the sub-array
appears exactly twice.”
Zapray remembers how to find the longest consecutive
sub-array so that each element in the sub-array appears exactly
once using sliding window. But he could not figure out how to


Input
The first line of the input has an integer $N$ ($1
\leq N \leq 10^5$), the length of the array. The second
line contains $N$ positive
integers giving the elements of the array. Each integer is no
larger than $10^5$.
Output
Output the length of the longest sub-array so that each
element in the sub-array appears exactly twice.
