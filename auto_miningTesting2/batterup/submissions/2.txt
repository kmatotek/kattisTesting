Here is a Python program that calculates a baseball player's slugging percentage using sabermetrics:

```python
def slugging_percentage():
    num_at_bats = int(input())
    at_bats = list(map(int,input().split()))

    total_bases = 0
    official_at_bats = 0
    for bat in at_bats:
        if bat >= 0:
            total_bases += bat
            official_at_bats += 1

    slugging_percentage = total_bases / official_at_bats
    print("%.4f" % slugging_percentage)


slugging_percentage()
```
This program reads in the total number of at-bats for a player, followed by the result of each at-bat. For each at-bat, we check if the result was an official at-bat (a walk is not considered an official at-bat). If it was, we add the number of bases the player earned to `total_bases` and increment the `official_at_bats` counter. After totalling all the bases and at-bats, we calculate and print the slugging percentage, preserving up to four decimal places.
