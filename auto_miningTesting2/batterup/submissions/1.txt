Here is a Python program for the given problem.

```python
n = int(input())
b = list(map(int, input().split()))
official_ab = len([x for x in b if x != -1])
total_bases = sum([x for x in b if x != -1])
print(total_bases / official_ab)
```
In this solution, we first read the number of at-bats from the user. Then, we read the outcomes of the at-bats and store them in a list. We count the total number of official at-bats (i.e., at-bats that are not walks) by filtering out the walks from the list and taking its length. We compute the total number of bases by summing up the official at-bats. Finally, we calculate and print the slugging percentage.
