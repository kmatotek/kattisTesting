Here is a Python program that can solve this problem:

```python
def rearrange(a, b, c, order):
    arr = [a, b, c]
    arr.sort()

    result = []
    for ch in order:
        if ch == 'A':
            result.append(str(arr[0]))
        elif ch == 'B':
            result.append(str(arr[1]))
        else: 
            result.append(str(arr[2]))

    return ' '.join(result)

a, b, c = map(int, input().strip().split())
order = input().strip()
print(rearrange(a, b, c, order))
```
This function works by creating a list (`arr`) from the input integers and sorting it. Then, it goes through the desired order and appends the corresponding integer (which is converted to a string) from the sorted list to the `result` list. Finally, it joins all elements in the `result` list with a space and returns the resulting string.

After defining the function, it takes three integers and the desired order as input, and then it calls the function with these inputs and prints the result.
