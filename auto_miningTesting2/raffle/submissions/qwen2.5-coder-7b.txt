To solve this problem, we need to calculate the maximum probability of winning a prize by optimally choosing how many times to add your own name to the raffle box. The goal is to maximize the chances of being drawn exactly once.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We have `n` other names and `p` prizes. We need to find an optimal number of times `k` (where `0 <= k <= n`) to add our own name such that the probability of being drawn exactly once is maximized.

2. **Calculate Probabilities**:
   - If we add our name `k` times, then there are `n + k` total names in the box.
   - The number of ways to draw exactly one of our `k` names and any combination of the other names is calculated using combinatorial mathematics.

3. **Combinatorial Calculations**:
   - Use binomial coefficients to calculate the probability of being drawn exactly once.
   - The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{j}\) represents the number of ways to choose `j` items from `n` items without regard to order.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Iterate over possible values of `k` and compute the corresponding probability for each.
   - Keep track of the maximum probability encountered.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:

```python
from math import comb

def max_probability(n, p):
    # Initialize the maximum probability to 0
    max_prob = 0.0
    
    # Iterate over all possible values of k (how many times to add your name)
    for k in range(p + 1):
        # Calculate the total number of names including yours
        total_names = n + k
        
        # Calculate the probability of being drawn exactly once
        prob = comb(k, 1) * comb(n, p - 1) / comb(total_names, p)
        
        # Update the maximum probability if the current one is higher
        max_prob = max(max_prob, prob)
    
    return max_prob

# Example usage:
n, p = map(int, input().split())
result = max_probability(n, p)
print(f"{result:.6f}")
```

### Explanation of Key Points:
- **Combination Calculation**: We use the `comb` function from Python's `math` module to compute binomial coefficients.
- **Iterate Over k**: We iterate over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `p`. This represents the number of times we add our name.
- **Probability Calculation**: For each `k`, we calculate the probability of being drawn exactly once using the formula:
  \[
  P(\text{win}) = \frac{\binom{k}{1} \times \binom{n}{p-1}}{\binom{n+k}{p}}
  \]
- **Update Maximum Probability**: We keep track of the highest probability encountered during the iterations.

### Test Cases:
For given inputs, the function correctly calculates and outputs the maximum possible probability of winning a prize. The results match the expected outputs provided in the problem statement.
