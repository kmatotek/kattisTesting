Here is a Python implementation for the problem:

```python
import sys

def rotateRight(grid):
    return [list(reversed(x)) for x in zip(*grid)]

def rotateLeft(grid):
    return list(list(x)[::-1] for x in zip(*grid))

def merge(grid):
    newGrid = [[0] * 4 for _ in range(4)]
    for i in range(4):
        pos = 0
        for j in range(4):
            if grid[i][j] != 0:
                newGrid[i][pos] = grid[i][j]
                pos += 1
        for j in range(pos, 4):
            newGrid[i][j] = 0
        for j in range(3):
            if newGrid[i][j] == newGrid[i][j + 1] and newGrid[i][j] != 0:
                newGrid[i][j] *= 2
                newGrid[i][j + 1] = 0
        pos = 0
        for j in range(4):
            if newGrid[i][j] != 0:
                newGrid[i][pos] = newGrid[i][j]
                pos += 1
        for j in range(pos, 4):
            newGrid[i][j] = 0
    return newGrid

def executeMove(move, grid):
    for _ in range(move):
        grid = rotateRight(grid)
    grid = merge(grid)
    for _ in range(4 - move):
        grid = rotateRight(grid)
    return grid

def printGrid(grid):
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            print(cell, end=' ')
        print()

grid = [list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())) for _ in range(4)]
move = int(sys.stdin.readline())

newGrid = executeMove(move, grid)

printGrid(newGrid)
```

This program reads the game state and the move from the standard input. It executes the requested move on the game state by rotating the grid to make the movement direction become "up", then condensing and merging the tiles, and finally rotating the grid back. After executing the move, the program outputs the new game state. 

Remember to run this program in an environment that has access to standard input (for example, a terminal or command prompt). If you're testing it in an IDE, ensure it supports input through stdin. This program doesn't generate the random tile. This should be taken into account while comparing its output with your expected outcome.
