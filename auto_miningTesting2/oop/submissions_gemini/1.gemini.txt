**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Descriptive Naming:** The code uses clear and descriptive names for variables and functions (e.g., `count_matching_phrases`, `match_pattern`, `phrase_collection`, `search_term`).
* **Function Decomposition:** The problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable functions: 
    - `count_matching_phrases`: Counts matching phrases in a collection.
    - `match_pattern`: Checks if a single phrase matches a search term with a wildcard.
* **Wildcard Handling:** The `match_pattern` function effectively handles the "*" wildcard by:
    - Splitting the search term into parts based on the '*'.
    - Checking if the phrase starts with the first part.
    - Verifying that all subsequent parts exist within the phrase in order.
* **Input and Output:** The `main` function handles reading input, calling the appropriate processing functions, and printing the output in the required format.
* **Efficiency:** The code is designed to be relatively efficient, especially for a large number of queries and phrases. The use of the `in` operator for substring searching is generally optimized in Python.
* **No External Libraries:** The solution relies solely on built-in Python features and libraries. 

**How to Run the Code:**

1. **Save:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `matej_oop.py`).
2. **Input:** Prepare an input file (e.g., `input.txt`) with data in the format specified in the problem.
3. **Run:** Execute the code from the command line, providing the input file: 

   ```bash
   python matej_oop.py < input.txt 
   ```

This will process the input, count the matches, and print the results to the console.
