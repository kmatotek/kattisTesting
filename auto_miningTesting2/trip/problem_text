A number of students are members of a club that travels
annually to exotic locations. Their destinations in the past
have included Indianapolis, Phoenix, Nashville, Philadelphia,
San Jose, and Atlanta. This spring they are planning a trip to
Eindhoven.
The group agrees in advance to share expenses equally, but
it is not practical to have them share every expense as it
occurs. So individuals in the group pay for particular things,
like meals, hotels, taxi rides, plane tickets, etc. After the
trip, each student’s expenses are tallied and money is
exchanged so that the net cost to each is the same, to within
one cent. In the past, this money exchange has been tedious and
time consuming. Your job is to compute, from a list of
expenses, the minimum amount of money that must change hands in


Input
Standard input will contain the information for several
trips (at most $5$). The
information for each trip consists of a line containing a
positive integer, $n$, the
number of students on the trip, followed by $n$ lines of input, each containing
the amount, in dollars and cents (i.e., with exactly two digits
after the decimal point), spent by a student. There are no more
than $1000$ students and
no student spent more than $\$
10\, 000.00$. A single line containing $0$ follows the information for the
last trip.
Output
For each trip, output a line stating the total amount of
money, in dollars and cents, that must be exchanged to equalize
the students’ costs.
